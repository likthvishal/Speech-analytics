Dataset -> Downloaded from  https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data?select=train.7z

Read Data from sub folders and create input data then Sound Wave Pre-processing was done. the model architecture was CNN + Bi Directional LSTM.
Finally we train model and record input from user and convert it to Text.
